# Vue Bingo Ball Picker

A bingo number picker made with Vue.js during the Covid-19 pandemic. You'll need your own cards and dabbers, and use this to select the bingo numbers.

My girlfriend planned a bingo style game for us to play but didn't have a bingo ball picker.
Since I'm just learning Vue.js and Vuetify, 
I figured this would be a good opportunity to use it.

It's a Vue App, so use [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) and then `npm run serve`. Or use the **[build here](https://ramchilla.github.io/vue-bingopicker/).**
