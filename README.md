# Vue Bingo Ball Picker

This is a bingo number picker made during the Covid-19 pandemic.
My girlfriend planned a bingo style game for us to play but didn't have a ball picker.
Since I'm just learning Vue.js and Vuetify, 
I figured this would be a good opportunity to use it.

It's a Vue App, so use [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) and then `npm run serve`. Or check out the build [here](https://ramchilla.github.io/vue-bingopicker/).
